# Solar Storm (CME) movie maker

Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are large scales eruptions from the Sun. They are studied in varying contexts for space weather, heliophysics and solar physics research. However, one of the first things to do to study a CME is to visualise it using coronagraph images, like those obtained from the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft. Here is a fun tool that you can use to make a movie of the CME of your interest!
